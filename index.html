        <div class="about-game">
            <p>The Simon game, invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, was first released in 1978 by Milton Bradley
                (now
                owned by Hasbro). It quickly became a popular electronic game and has remained a classic ever since.

                <span>Who is "Simon" ?</span>
                <br>
                <span>
                    "Simon" typically refers to the electronic device itself rather than a specific individual. The name "Simon" was chosen
                    by the creators of the game, Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, and it has since become synonymous with the game
                    itself.

                                yellow.
                                Each button corresponds to a specific color and emits a distinct sound when pressed.</li>

                            <li class="list-components">The game starts with Simon lighting up one or more buttons in a random sequence accompanied by their respective sounds.</li>
                            <li class="list-components">The player must then repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.</li>
                            <li class="list-components">If the player correctly repeats the sequence, Simon adds a new random color to the end of the sequence and repeats the
                            pattern.</li>
                            <li class="list-components">The game continues in this manner, with Simon progressively increasing the length of the sequence, until the player
                            makes a mistake.</li>
